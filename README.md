# inventoryManager
GUI based inventory manager

Overview: This application helps people/businesses manage their inventory. The inventory is categorized into "parts" and "products" where parts make up a product. For example, a manufacturer may need screws, nails, hinges(parts) in order to make their door frames(product). When running the application, users are able to add, modify, and delete parts and products from the inventory. 

Technical: This Java/JavaFX application was built using IntelliJ IDEA. The GUI was constructed via SceneBuilder. This application does not have a database; instead, parts and products are Java objects. Upon loading, the initial parts and products that are shown are hard coded into the application. Additions, modifications, and deletions of parts and products are only temporarily saved. When exiting the program, any changes that were made are removed.
